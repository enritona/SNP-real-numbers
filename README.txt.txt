Hello, thanks for being interested in our work. 

We share with you the entire project to test our Pproposal named :

"Real number SN P circuit for adder and subtractor with astrocytelike
dendrite selection behavior based on colored spikes"

The project was develop on VHDL and tested with Quartus 19, from Altera. 
If you want to test, first you need to install Quartus

Then export the project and run it.
